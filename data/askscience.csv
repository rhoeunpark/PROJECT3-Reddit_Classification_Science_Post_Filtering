unaikd,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

ui79ix,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

uhdifs,"Hi, Reddit. We're Rachel Davis, MD, (u/racheldavismd) and Moksha Patel, MD, (u/mokshapatelmd). We're here to answer your questions about deep brain stimulation and OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder. If you are struggling with OCD, you are not alone. Treatments and care are evolving.

Deep brain stimulation or DBS is a rare, invasive brain surgery where electrodes are implanted in the deeper structures of the brain. These electrodes are then connected to generators in the chest that deliver small currents of electricity to the brain, similar to cardiac pacemakers.

About Rachel:

I'm Rachel Davis, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I'm also medical director of the OCD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, program and co-director of the OCD surgical program. I've extensively studied deep brain stimulation for OCD and have worked with candidates, like Moksha, before, during and after the process.

About Moksha:

And I'm Moksha Patel, senior instructor of hospital medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine where I hold many roles. I've always been high-achieving and busy my whole life; working hard has helped me cope with crippling OCD. I recently worked with Dr. Davis and many others to undergo deep brain stimulation.

I've put in a lot of work with Dr. Davis programming my stimulator settings and engaging in intensive exposure therapy. It's been a challenging process, but I'm happy to say I'm feeling relief; I am more engaged in life and can travel, go out with friends and go about my day to day without being completely stuck in my head. I'm also working toward an MBA at the University of Colorado Denver.

udscjl,"Hi, Reddit. I'm Dr. Richard Johnson, a professor of medicine specializing in renal health and hypertension at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I'm also an adjunct professor at the University of Florida. I'm board certified in internal medicine, infectious diseases and kidney disease.

For more than 20 years, I have investigated the impact of sugar, especially fructose, on the human body and how we process it. I recently wrote *Nature Wants Us to be Fat*, a book outlining why evolution has programmed us to overeat on the promise that we will lose weight during lean times. However, it's no longer feast or famine - it's just feast.

My research reveals that we, as humans, all have a 'survival switch' that protects against starvation, but it's now stuck in the 'on' position.

Prior to my most recent book, I also authored, *The Sugar Fix* (2008) and *The Fat Switch* (2012). I've had the pleasure of lecturing in more than 40 countries and have been funded by the National Institutes of Health.

So, with that:

+ Why does nature want us to be fat?
+ What do we have in common with hibernating bears, sperm whales and the world's fattest bird?

ud4960,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

* Glass composition (tempered, leaded, pyrex)
* Glass thickness
* Whether having Kool-Aid in his bowl is a plus or a minus
* Where his structural weak points would be, given that the impact point should distribute much of the force through the Kool-Aid and around the perimeter of the spherical bowl before it hits the handle/top/feet

Basically, we're wondering within the parameters of reasonable building materials and dimension, both for Kool-Aid Man and the wall, whether he could survive.

uc9w5t,"Anyone who has visited a doctor knows that medical diagnostic tests (which analyze biomarkers contained in fluids like blood, urine and saliva) are critical in helping to diagnose and interpret a whole variety of signs of health. But did you know that there are roughly 13 BILLION diagnostic medical tests performed every year, just in the United States? With such a high level of demand, there is a constant need for the development of diagnostic approaches with increased accuracy, higher sensitivity, and lower costs.

Unfortunately, as illustrated by several recent scandals (such as that involving former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, recently the subject of the Hulu show The Dropout), such great need means that the field of medical diagnostics can also be prone to great fraud. So how do professionals ensure the efficacy, safety and utility of diagnostics tests? What requirements and standards have regulators put in place to protect against fraud and abuse?

Join us today at 3 PM ET (19 UT) for an open discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to discuss the field of medical diagnostics. We'll answer your questions about the research, regulatory and policy aspects of diagnostics. Ask us anything!

With us today are:

u7x6ke,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).
