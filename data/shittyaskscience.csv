The dream starts with the flower pot in my room crying. I take good care of that plant so I got worried and got up from my bed. I asked him what's wrong? He accused me of sexually harassing him for the past two years!!! I was shocked!!! I thought maybe I sleep naked that's why Timothy is saying that (yes I named him Timothy). So I start wearing my pajamas but he stopped me saying that's not the reason for his tears. 

He's a black rose plant and I like smelling his flowers, touching and sometimes even plucking them. And it was all with good intention. What I never realized is that flowers are actually PLANT GENITALS!!! So I have been touching, smelling and PLUCKING HIS GENITALS EVERYDAYY!! I have also gifted his genitals to some of my friends 🤮 I felt ashamed. I tried to apologize but he wouldn't let me near him. Then he got angry. 

One of his branches grew big and wrapped around my legs so I couldn't move. Like that Evil Dead scene!! Then his other branch grabbed MY genitalia and as he started to pull …… I woke up *phew*

This whole dream happened because I forgot to take off my underwear that night and my private area was actually hurting 😶

But now I don't even look at Timothy's flowers and have also forbidden my little sister from doing so. I even water him with my eyes blindfolded.

this is the historical basis of it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrage_balloon

see here: 

&gt;Creating a no-fly-zone may not end the war, but it should buy more time to find a way out for Putin without further bloodshed. Now add modern wireless technology to history! Consider hundreds of tethered balloons protected by hundreds of small high speed camera drones and suicide drones, Firstly the balloons must be raised and lowered rapidly when needed; and secondly, the drones must communicate with Mission Control, located in a protected underground bunker, and their locations displayed on a large screen in real time, using their on-board GPS coordinates. Squadrons of 10 are programmed to move together in a V formation at a specified separation distance. When a squadron locks on to an approaching aircraft, the leader remains on target while the others peel off and Mission Control takes over. The task is to patrol the boundary and protect the cities. Ultimately, as soon as a Russian aircraft appears at the airport, ready for take-off, a suicide drone dive bombs from 5,000 feet.

the person said this too: 

&gt;Thousands of small movable red barrage balloons on long cables raised quickly on air raid alert and lowered but visible on all-clear. Firstly demonstrated on humanitarian escape routes, and secondly on the major cities, harbours and airports. Protected by hundreds of small unarmed suicide drones seeking incoming aircraft. Objective is to claim and govern neutral territory, defining the new geographic Ukraine.

&gt;Yes, it's my idea. And the balloons are protected by a swarm of small suicide drones with ground pilots to intercept and encircle the attackers, and also move the balloons mounted on trucks with fast raise and lower control. The tether cables are light aluminum. Signals from the balloons are displayed on a large screen deep underground. The recent loss of 35 men at a Ukraine military training base is inexcusable!

t7ig1x,"Hi guys. For a little background on myself, I have an engineering degree. I love to question things and find out how they work. It irks me that we just accept gravity as a fundamental force with no explanation. I am aware that some advanced theories such as string theory have attempted to explain gravity but imo it has too many problems/assumptions which is why it hasn't gained wide acceptance.

I will attempt to provide a simple explanation for gravity with this post. It may seem kind of ""out there"" but I am being 100% serious and would like to have a serious discussion about either proving or disproving my theory. With that being said, here is my theory:



We've all heard gravity described as an acceleration. Here on the surface of Earth the acceleration of gravity is about 9.81 m/s^(2). The idea has always seemed counter-intuitive to me. Sure, an object in free fall is accelerating relative to the ground. But what about a stationary object, for example a book sitting on a shelf. Is that accelerating too? How can it be accelerating with a constant velocity of 0?

The answer is yes, it is accelerating... *upward*. To illustrate my point, imagine sitting in a dragster as it peels away from the start line. You're forced into the back of the seat as the car accelerates forward. Now imagine taking the seat out of the car and laying it on its back on the ground. If you sit in it, you'll feel the same sensation of being pressed into the back of the seat. This is because you're accelerating into the sky.

So what's really going on here? Herein lies the crux of my theory. **Gravity isn't the acceleration of mass through space, it's the acceleration of space through mass**. Space is drawn toward matter like water flowing down a drain. Imagine a wide river flowing into a narrow water fall. The river has to speed up as it gets closer to the fall. This is where the acceleration comes from. Space is accelerating past us as it gets closer to Earth. Because our frame of reference (space) is accelerating downward, we need to accelerate upward in order to remain stationary.

There are two types of time dilation, gravitational and kinetic. According to my theory, they are the same phenomenon. We know that in order to move through space you have to give up some movement through time. This is why astronauts age slightly slower than people on earth. They are moving very fast through space. It is also why photons are said to be timeless. They have given up all of their movement through time in exchange for maximum possible velocity through space.

Now remember what I said about gravity being space moving past us. Is there a difference between space moving through you or you moving through space? In a practical sense, no. Space moving through you would incur the same cost of movement through time, which is what we observe in gravitational time dilation. Time slows for people under the influence of gravity just as if they were moving through space (or space were moving through them).

Since they are explaining the same phenomenon, setting the equations for gravitational and kinetic time dilation equal to each other should allow you to learn the velocity of space at any given point as well as other attributes such as its compressibility. However the math is all very complicated so it's been pretty frustrating and slow going for me.

What are your thoughts? Does any of this make sense or am I just crazy? I came up with this theory independently, but after doing some digging I've seen that it has been posted before, though never in a serious academic setting to my knowledge.",Armchair Physicist here.

Currently, I’m hypothesizing that bagels eat seagulls, which is why they’re never seen together. But if that’s true, why haven’t bagels overtaken seagulls yet? Seagulls still frolic happily near seasides AND the Great Lakes.

scaojn,"Hi everyone,

Wanted to ask a question to help settle a debate between my girlfriend and I.

We are conflicted as to the force of collisions for two objects moving in the same direction.

If two objects are moving in the same direction in a straight line, one is travelling 40km/h and one is travelling 20km/h, would the initial force of the impact be the same as a collision with a object travelling 80km/h  and one travelling 60km/h (rear end collision)

We are in agreement that the higher speed collision would be worse following the collision due to a greater deceleration. However we aren't relating to the initial force of the impact.

Could someone please elaborate on the answer and hopefully confirm with appropriate math?

It’s taken me awhile to consider this, but the facts keep presenting themselves to me; drugs seem to have little if any effect when I take them. When I smoke weed, I feel almost nothing. At first I thought I was doing something wrong, I kept smoking to try to feel something. I’ve sat with experienced smokers around a bong and been told “Take this hit bro you’ll be faded”… nothing. I’ve done cocaine lines and had friends spazzed and wired around me meanwhile I’m fully functional and quite close to normal. Recently I got a batch of shrooms from someone and they told me “Don’t take this all at once, a full dose like this will make you trip balls and reach ego death” - I went against what they said took the whole amount and yeah I felt a little different but nothing crazy. The other night I took ecstasy for the first time and was vowed by all the experienced ravers of how other worldly of an experience it was. Throughout the night I keep asking “Is it gonna hit? How do I know when it will hit?” An hour after taking it I barely felt anything except a dry mouth. 

I say all this to say, is it possible for someone to have a rare trait where they’re immune to stimulants? I can’t think of any other explanation… unless I’ve been given an ironic series of duds my whole life 😂 Someone help me understand this please.",Is it possible to be immune to drugs?,1643078679,shittyaskscience

My question is this: if we nuked Japan today, would the resulting switch from Left-dominant to Right-dominant require them to change their reading and writing standards or would they still be right to left literate? If we sent all left handed individuals to Japan for said detonation (and they lived, I'm not a dumbass) would they suddenly be literate in Western society again?

* Given the consensus that any religious person has an effective blessing range (when it comes to water) directly related to their religious ranking. How holy would you have to be to ""bless the rains down in Africa""? Or is the question void, as the water droplets in the rains down in africa aren't connected?
* How much of the rains down in Africa has Toto blessed by now? Is Africa a vampire-safe travel destination?
* Can we further Toto's pet project by blasting his song? Can we do it from home or do we have to be in africa to actually bless the rains there?
* Similarly, does rain count as running water? After all, it is moving, only perpendicular to the common direction when one talks about running water.
* Does falling snow count as running water? After all, it is water, stuck together in place to create snowflakes (and therefore it's probably not moving) but then it does also fall and therefore move (or not, see question above)
* Do glaciers count? I mean, it's (frozen) water moving albeit very slowly. 
* Does the water need a specific speed to be considered ""Running water""? 
* If so, what is this speed? Could some glaciers be vampire safe and some not?
* Is water that's moving perfectly laminar and at perfectly consistent speed safe for vampires? After all, due to relativity we could pick a reference that's moving along the water, and to that reference it wouldn't be running water.",Some questions for a new vampire hunter...,1641561477,shittyaskscience

Today 2 hoodies came in(fruit of loom) and I put one on without washing wore it for about 20 minutes(I didn't know about clothing chemicals) but it had a terrible weird smell. I also accidentally sniffed it(it was a pullover hoodie wich means my face came in direct  contact and could smell it when taking it on/off wich i did 4 times). I also previously ordered 15 t-shirts(wich haven't washed yet) wich came in weeks ago wich I've had in my closet in my room where I spend most of my time  for 2 weeks. Im kinda worried I may have poisoned myself. I'm wondering whats the appropriate action to take here regarding the smelly hoodie should I just dispose of it ?

Edit:I ended up putting the clothes outside in open plastic bags to air our for like 5 hours and full of snow got into the bags and now i brought them inside after 5 hours and some of that snow from the bag fell on my floor so now it's permanently infested.

OK so... 

I think calculating this would take a good deal of research. I'm not expecting any actual answers, but by all means - please do if you're feeling inspired! What I'm curious about, is how would you calculate this? 

I'm thinking you'd look up the number of duck boat trips per year, and figure the average passenger load. Same with planes. Then you add up the fatalities over the same span of time. 

Then you divide the casualties by the survivors then compare percentages? Does that sound right? How would you do it?",How much more likely are you to die on a Duck boat than on an airplane?,1638242826,shittyaskscience

As far as im aware moles are basically benign cancerous growths in their early stages that arent of concern, im not sure if this is the same for the other types of spots shown but my concern comes from the fact I will be using HGH soon at 4iu a day. HGH increases growth signalling which could tip these otherwise benign/under control cancerous growths into full blown cancer. Basically asking whether these are a real concern or nothing I should be worried about.

Each must be true, probably true, insufficient data, probably false or false.

**Statement of Facts**: Some time ago a crowd gathered in Middletown to hear the new president of the Chamber of Commerce speak. The president said, “I am not asking, but demanding, that labor unions now accept their full share of responsibility for civic improvement and community welfare. I am not asking, but demanding, that they join the Chamber of Commerce.” The members of the Central Labor Unions who were present applauded enthusiastically. Three months later all the labor unions in Middletown were represented in the Chamber of Commerce. These representatives worked with representatives of other groups on committees, spoke their minds, participated actively in the civic improvement projects, and helped the Chamber reach the goals set in connection with those projects.

**Inference**: Both the labor union representatives and the other members of the committee came to a better recognition of one another's viewpoints through their Chamber of Commerce contacts.

**Inference**: Union participation in the Middletown Chamber of Commerce greatly reduced worker-management disputes in that town.

**Inference**: The active participation of the labor unions resolved many controversies at all the committee meetings of the Chamber of Commerce.

**Inference**: Most of the union representatives regretted having accepted the invitation to participate in the Chamber of Commerce.",Watson Glaser,1634745341,shittyaskscience

So lets try to calculate 1 BTC mass using relativity theory


Simple calculation using the mass energy equivalence principle for bitcoin. 

Here is a simplified approach to calculate what is the mass (weight) of a single bitcoin.

We start with energy consumed to create bitcoins. For 2020 it is estimated that global consumption of energy related to bitcoin mining was:

110 TWh (terra watt hours)

which is an equivalent to:

396000000000000000 joules

of energy.

Using the mass energy equivalence principle (e=mc^2) the estimated mass of all bitcoins created in 2020 is:

4.40609 kg

In 2020 on average there were like 900 blocks a day, each having 6.25 btc created in each block. So in the whole 2020 year there were about 

328 500 btc

created.

So finally we get the mass of a single btc:

0,000013412754947 kg

Simplified thought experiment ... but bear in mind that this 1.3e-5 kg is worth today about 37k USD. This is approx.

500 usd per gram.

Lets compare it with some known substances:

gold 60 usd per gram

cocaine 300 usd per gram

plutonium 4000 usd per gram

diamonds 55 000 usd per gram

The question is why the seperation between thick/dense/fast and thin/sparse/slow hairs in my beard is exactly the line that I drew? I even drew each side's line a little different (one is ruler straight while the other a little curved) and the hair type is behaving accordingly..

I even noticed that the roots of the higher parts were white while the lower ones were only white when I started shaving and after afew shaves they became black roots, while the higher parts stayed white till much longer.

 The issue I have is mainly when I stand up from the chair and touch the back of it. It always gives me this insanely sharp, audible shock. 
I would have chalked it up to maybe there's more electricity or faulty wiring there but none of my coworkers seem to experience it (we all wear the same uniform as well, jeans and a polo) so I was wondering if it was just me generating the charge?

So I decided to bring my question here follow a few more things that follow this. 

Let’s say, theoretically you can withstand all the heat and other aspects of what is preventing us from actually digging down that far, what would actually happen?

Would the gravity stay static the entire time? Or once you reach the dead center would there be no gravity?

If you did “fall” down from one point of the hole, would you gain enough velocity to just go flying out of the other side (going fast enough to temporarily counteract gravity)? Or would you just be stopped dead in your tracks once you reach the middle?

It is a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide and methane. It contributes to soil and beach erosion. There was an incident in December 2004 in South Asia involving dihydrogen monoxide that killed hundreds of thousands of people. There was another incident in March 2011 in Japan involving dihydrogen monoxide that killed thousands people.

Despite these risks, it is used in the food and beverage industries and as an industrial solvent, and it is even in our water supply.

p4t9ga,"Below is what i am thinking about Planck length. Am i correct?

The smallest unit of space is only the smallest unit of space from your point of reference. Outside of a black hole's reference point, you measure one Planck length. Inside the event horizon you measure and get the same one Planck length. The same measurement also occurs at the single point inside of a black hole.

From outside of your point of reference they measure and it is not the same as your measurement when calculating the difference in size according to both your reference points compared to being on the inside of the event horizon or being on the outside of the event horizon or existing at the single point itself or existing inside of the single point. They can't see to calculate anything smaller from their point of reference. Comparison is the only way? To do the comparison we have to say one Planck length “or the smallest unit of space” is not the smallest unit of space and is only the smallest unit of space calculated at your point of reference and not from another point of reference. Yet both are true. You calculate the same value from your own references. 

If you are crushed down to a single point already and you measure, you will calculate that one Planck length is that much smaller than yourself or the atoms around you just like in your previous calculation. This will be the same result anywhere.

The measurement is then different depending on your location in a black hole. Such as existing as part of the single point or whether your on the accretion disk. We have to calculate that the smallest unit of space is that much smaller than what we say Planck length is. There existing no limits.

oyyyj7,"I have the ultimate man made plan that requires every nation on earth to cooperate. The biggest undertaking there can be. I want to build one ring around the earth in the vacuum of space in segments. This is only the first ring. It will match the angle to go all the way around the earth in segments and latch together and then we build another ring. The second ring will be 90 degrees offset from the other. We hollow the earth out and make more rings and put a man made sun in the middle and we can now travel across space with the earth to another star or sun.

We separate earth materials to keep harmful materials away from people when we create our surface around our rings. At some point people migrate to the rings as the size of earth is being reduced. These rings are longer around than the whole earth and they are interlinked, maybe some separate. Shortcuts through locks to shuttle from ring to ring will be possible. Our sun will be in the middle and we can build a glass sphere around it. Or not. I thought of having a giant mirror for bouncing light back from our homemade sun but then we wouldn't see the stars if we used a giant mirror to reflect the homemade sunlight back to the ground on our rings. We could just simply make a glass sphere above the highest ring. We could also use fewer mirrors and then create a day and night with rotational mirrors near the top of the glass sphere to reflect sunlight light down. The mirrors can be gradually rotated. Think of rotational mirrors where the glass sphere is that rotate to reflect the sunlight from our homemade sun back to the tops of the rings where we will be living. Or we will simply use orbiting mirrors and only part of our Earth will have sunlight at a time like normal on earth. Two ways to accomplish this. We can still have our glass sphere above all the rings in free float.

At first I was thinking about erecting giant pillars as high as the vacuum of space to create our first rings then I realized it is better to just orbit the rings and then interlink them. We can do this via superconducting magnets with gaps or we can do this via physical connection bolted together or via giant locks that lock right into place. The plan is to hollow the earth out as evenly as possible and put all the materials up on the rings. Eventually our ring cage system will be 10 times the size of the earth or larger in total occupational surface area. 

We can then travel across the universe while using our sun for a power source and or for the engine that takes us across space via a rotating ball of plasma. The sun will be where earths core was or around the earths core. We can have other propulsion technology built in to our new earth outside of the man me sun for straighter controlled navigation. I wasn't sure if i wanted the rings to spin separate or as one big spinning cage. We have the possibility in keeping the rings separate and spinning them in different directions. Some rings will be higher than others. We will have to move atmosphere too or create our own.

If anything we can make a movie out of this. Halo move over. The ultimate spaceship is the whole earth. Now we can travel anywhere and mine resources. We can call this EarthShip or Earth Ship. We will take advantage of spin for gravity and the sun in the center will provide some gravity too. Hurry up Iter.",Is it possible that we can make the earth a spaceship.

[–]thebudman_420 0 points 7 hours ago* &lt;-- odd this time is completely wrong. This was minutes ago and i haven't been writing this for 7 hours either.

The weird thing in all this, You never reach the velocity of light, You gained a lot of mass at 99.9 percent the velocity of light. You measure the velocity of light going away from you and sure enough the light is traveling away from you at the same velocity from your frame of reference. You gained nothing on it. You did not gain the smallest unit of space distance to the light moving away from you. I mean it this way. The light moving away is moving away at a specific rate. A unit of space at a time. This rate stayed the same according to your point of reference. Your velocity and mass do not make a difference. Does not change this. You can't slow the increase in units of space distance the light is away from you at any point in time. I am assuming this is all in a vacuum and not a medium. So when i look to see where the light is. The light will always be the same distance from you directly after passing you up at any specific calculated time in a perfect vacuum no matter your velocity when you measure. This is in any direction, toward or away from you. Your retina or camera lens can only see the light that hits your retina or camera lens anyway.

I decided not to say Planck Length as not every scientist is certain this is the smallest size.

If you ended up traveling the velocity of light and went faster. I believe this will happen. You look and what do you see? There is nothing. Not even light. The light has not arrived to the eye yet. You are now are the largest. You are everywhere in superposition. Nothing relative. Infinite is the only size you can be. Nothing relative means your also everything and there is nothing else according to reference. So massive light cannot achieve escape velocity. You cannot escape the mass of everything. It is like going straight up. I believe you created a new universe. Other things that happen. You try to move and cannot move like a trapped particle so you vibrate and create a wave. All the other things happen that created a black hole and another universe. I actually believe there are infinite universes and a new universe every instance in time but not from your point of reference. I also think everything including you are either more strongly or weakly entangled with everyone and everything else in your world depending on how much and how often you interact. Explains a lot of things to be honest. Love, Relationship, those weird coincidences and jinxes type things. Entanglement can affect this. Two people who are deeply in love strongly entangled in their lives mutually feel close to each other even when far away sometimes like there is a connection. Like entangled strings. From a universe reference no two things occupy the same space and you have Planck length. From another reference. Instantly everywhere, everything else moved unnoticeable from your own reference. Entanglement is easier to notice in a particle from an alternative reference as particles are tiny and are affected more and we are entirely particles. Now superposition. Think of superposition as stopped and everything else is in every position. Yet superposition says the particle is in every position. Has spin. It is also every time or in every time. From a universe point of reference it takes time to go from point a to point b yet it went into all of those positions at once. So i like to think of time like this. Every Planck length of space off a perfect 3D sphere in any direction takes time to go from point a to b. The single point still has spin yet no time because of superposition according to a single points own reference with nothing relative. You are part of it and it takes time to go from point a to b. Because of spin this determines time even though the single point is in superposition. When you go faster and become more massive you get closer to a sun in superposition. Also above when you try to move and are trapped you just kind of spin and wobble and roll around. Rolling is obviously spin. Because the particle cannot move forward when traveling forward the particle spins because the outer layers are pressing inward equally in all directions while trapped. When there is only two of you determining spin and orbit depends on your point of reference. Am i spinning or are you orbiting around me? A 3rd point of reference can say your spinning and the other is orbiting. Spin one person in a room on space station while blackened and you two being the only light sources while looking directly at each other. Trippy effect. Orbit is also spin. Think the inner ring of a fidget spinner. It completes one circle / spin just like an orbit. Tidally locked planets and moons still spin around one complete circle every orbit. Although it is like going around a ring in a fidget spinner. Center of mass changes to where the ring / orbit is. The fabric of space where you see the stars including around you and everything else is a sort of equilibrium, darkness on this side and if you could put your hands in front of you and peal back the fabric of space you would see a sun that is infinite from your point of reference. Infinite is everywhere. ""you would never survive and you destroyed your universe and many others and there was the creation of another. Because of timeline and choice and every action splitting the timeline, both things play out or every other thing that you didn't do. You still have free will. Another you has another, there own free will. There is an infinite number of mes and yous. One for every possibility. It all plays out. It doesn't all happen in your timeline. Choice determines what happens in your timeline. If there is no space between you. You are the same thing otherwise your two.

We always have both truths in a singularity type paradox. All things become true. ""Not from your reference"" Finite to infinite in a black hole, Every time, no time or any time such as superposition. You can never describe the singularity, only measure and calculate things at your point of reference or others you know about. Superposition and the velocity of light and time have something in common.

""A recent thought The core of a single point so massive there has to be an inversion of space where the outer layers are pressing inward to the center constantly so hard space inverts itself inside out as the outer layers are constantly being pressed inward toward the center as what is center when the outside layers are now center and this process never stops"" &lt;-- wackiest thought i have had. The realm of space there has to be very trippy and wonky.

I also believe this about particles just like stars and planets. The outer layers of material always press inward to the core or very center of a 3D spherical object in all directions. This means the outer layers also have some mass. This creates pressure inward to the core crushing the particles most center causing them to become more densely packed or more dense. The very center has the most mass because of this. Scientist find what they call a higgs boson. You shed off the outer layers of a particles. The particle is less broad having a smaller diameter but still most of the mass. You can keep doing this until you get a black hole i believe. You have to get shed off all the outer layers.

Also when traveling that fast from another reference you was stretched into a thin string like if you used a black holes event horizon to accelerate yourself.

I found a solution to traveling quickly in the vacuum of space and slowing down quickly. Take a fidget spinner and spin it on your finger and flip the fidget spinner without slowing it down with your finger past it's point of inertia. You have to force it.

It slows both the spin and momentum of the fidget spinner. And this could be how we travel and slow down in space. In other words. We will need thrust at that time. To flip 90 degrees opposite of spin. A quarter turn. Now if we design floors at the right angle and spin like a fidget spinner we introduce some artificial gravity to the floor. Now a way to help spin. We spin a big ball of rotating plasma centered. Or fusion reactor so hurry up fusion power that's always decades away.

We could use nuclear reactors but make sure most the mass is centered directly or centered around a ring. So we use something with more mass there and we spin it. Densest materials centered where we need more mass. Keep our outer layers light as possible from heaviest to the lightest going outward. Although a shell for our atmosphere.

If you used rockets to slow down by aiming them the opposite direction of travel it would take a long time after gaining a lot of momentum to slow down. Stopping quickly lets us get almost all the way there and we slow down enough to orbit or land when we are there. Saving a lot of time. We lose artificial gravity though.

Lets used a superconducting centered ring. No friction in our spin? We can have physically unconnected parts that spin using extreme magnetism and superconductors with no friction. We can rotate screws and bolts with magnetism at home or in a shop. We have maglev trains. We have the emals catapult launchers on aircraft carries.

We have everything we need if we go nuclear reactor but better if we eventually attain stable fusion power. Nuclear is the dangerous way. Now we build it all in space in orbit. Lets make it all simple. Toolless if we can. We can use a Lagrange point if we have to. Parts go up and lock in place. There will be a standard so everything fits.

We could build the reactor in space and the fuel rods be delivered one at a time with crew if safe or without crew if not safe and will be an over ocean launch. The fuel rods could be extremely protected for lifting up to orbit in case our ride blows up. Then can be recovered. We standardize large intact pieces that can fit on falcon heavy or something that go together easily. Make our spaceship an international program. Another reason for a ring. Imagine something centered that spins and vacuum of space then a ring unconnected that you can also spin with magnetism or keep stationary. Our nuclear reactor will stay cool and be physically disconnected. Electromagnetism can power our ship alone. If the vacuum of space can't chill our reactor alone then we will spin water around it exposed to vacuum of space or covered by a thin sheet. Taking this approach the centered reactor will need to be controlled remotely. Now i know one thing. Our ship can be like a train. Nothing needs to be physically connected to travel together because of magnetism and electromagnetism. We can all be pods that spin around a central point. We can spin one way and the center the other way. Like that cool toy that spins in your hand. The globe toys.

Basically I have to put carrots in very cold and very hot environments, it sounds super dumb because it is but this was the only shitty experiment i got approved in class because my others had cyanobacteria and my class is too boring for that. anyway, i figured that, since different carrots will be going into either the hot or cold environments, a hotplate might work for the hot environment and ill just cut the carrot to fit on it. the trouble is that i want the respective environments to be relatively constant since ill have to observe the carrots over at least a few days in their environments, so I feel like just doing a normal ice bath for the cold environment wouldn't be constant at all or controllable since im also trying to go with somewhat incremental increases/decreases of temp. this is making me wonder if there are either any hotplates that can also go to at least a reliable 0 degrees celsius or if there are any other ideas? cost is also an issue :/ thank you for any help!",Need some help finding coldplate equipment please please,1621150555,shittyaskscience

So you know how the particle accelerator at CERN can make new particles by smashing other ones together? Well what if we get some abundant particle that we don't really need, then we can make adjustments to the LHC to optimize the transformation of our chosen particle into something more useful, like gold so i can stop being poor. Now you might be thinking I'm going to say we use air or something, but air is actually pretty important for the survival of most things on Earth, so we won't use that. I was thinking we first set up a cobblestone generator and turn the cobblestone into gold using the LHC. Its pretty easy to make, only requiring a single water source and a single lava source which we can probably get from a volcano or something. However, a more efficient and thus complex design would likely be more beneficial in the long run.

The problem is, however, that the LHC takes a really long time to turn stuff into gold, i didnt bother to read most of it, but it would take around 3 million years to create one gram ([Andy Buckley](https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-could-gold-be-created-at-the-CERN-Large-Hadron-Collider#:~:text=It's%20surprisingly%20hard%20to%20find,be%20radioactive%20and%20rapidly%20decaying)). So if I wanted, for example, one gram per year, we would need either 3 million particle accelerators, or to speed up the process by 3 million times. 3 million accelerators sounds expensive, so im gonna go for the second option, I mean it can't be that hard to make the particles go 3 million times faster, right?
